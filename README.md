# Frontend Setup

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd your-repo
```

### 2. Navigate to Frontend Directory
```bash
cd frontend
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Build for Production
Before deploying to Vercel, ensure your build works correctly:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will check for any build-time errors that need to be resolved before deployment.

## Deployment

Once the build completes successfully without errors, you're ready to deploy to Vercel or your preferred hosting platform.
